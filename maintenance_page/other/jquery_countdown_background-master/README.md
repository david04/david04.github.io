# jQuery Countdown with Shaded Background and Overlay

This example uses Keith Wood's [jQuery Countdown](http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html) library to do the countdown itself and uses background images and a div that is overlaid on top of the text for further affect.

Check demo.html for a way to use this code.
